`mygem` is just a minimal Ruby Gem I made to learn Gem-cutting.
It is only a `gem`, no `rake`.

Its goal is to be an almost-bare-minimum example of a Ruby Gem.
But it is also complete in file-structure conventions.

It’s also enhanced with the GitHub Actions workflow
[`package.yml`](.github/workflows/package.yml),
which publishes to [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/mygem_paradoxv5)
whenëver a GitHub Release is published.

This gem doubles as a sandbox I experiment with to prepare
[`template-ruby-gem`](https://github.com/ParadoxV5/template-ruby-gem).
